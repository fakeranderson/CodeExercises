# CodeExercises
Solutions to exercises I've worked through on different platforms

The structure (as of this writing I'm all C++), is a namespace for each platform, and classes for each "section." For example, Advent of Code 2020 is a ns and each day is a class. The class contains all of the functions to solve the problems of the day. All statics because I don't have all damned night.
