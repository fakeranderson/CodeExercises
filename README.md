# CodeExercises
Solutions to exercises I've worked through on different platforms

Each file has a main function, which is why almost all of the code is commented out. SORRY I didn't feel like doing any fancy linking or classes. 
All of the Codility exercises got 100% (but I wouldn't call that "impressive" because infinite trial and error is allowed).
